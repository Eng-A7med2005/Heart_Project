# Heart_Project
This project is a heart disease prediction system using a machine learning model. The model analyzes medical input data and predicts the likelihood of heart disease. The interface, built with customtkinter, allows users to input their health parameters, and the model returns a prediction with color-coded results for easy interpretation.
